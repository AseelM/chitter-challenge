These can be viewed by the public via a web application. The following user stories will be satisfied.\r\n\r\nSite setup:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Run site on local server: `$ rackup`\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting setup:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Run RSpec tests: `$ rspec`\r\n\r\n\r\nUser stories:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs a new user\r\nSo that I can post messages on Chitter as me\r\nI want to sign up for Chitter\r\n\r\nAs a new user who loves their username\r\nSo that I know my username is shared with no others\r\nI want the sign-up protocol to only allow me to use a unique username\r\n\r\nAs a user who is ready to peep\r\nSo that I can post messages on Chitter as me\r\nI want to log in to Chitter\r\n\r\nAs a security conscious user\r\nSo that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me\r\nI want to log out of Chitter\r\n\r\nAs a security conscious user\r\nSo that others cannot log into my account\r\nI want to validate the login process with a secret password\r\n\r\nAs a forgetful user\r\nSo that I can reset my password if I forget it\r\nI want to be able to do so via a password recovery system\r\n\r\nAs a user with something to share\r\nSo that I can let people know what I am doing\r\nI want to post a message (peep) to chitter\r\n\r\nAs a user who likes to keep up to date with others\r\nSo that I can see what others are saying\r\nI want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order\r\n\r\nAs a user who likes to know who has said what\r\nSo that I can which peeps are attributed to which user\r\nI want this information displayed alongside each peep\r\n\r\nAs a pedantic user\r\nSo that I can better appreciate the context of a peep\r\nI want to see the time at which it was made\r\n\r\nAs a user without much time\r\nSo that I can see all peep info without having to be signed in\r\nI want that to be displayed regardless of being signed in/out\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnologies used:\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Written in Ruby, tested with Rspec and Capybara\r\n- DataMapper and Postgresql for DB\r\n- Bcrypt for password encryption\r\n- Mailgun API for email integration\r\n- Served by Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for looks\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus Features:\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n- User can request a new password and receive a password token via email\r\n- User must be signed in to post a Peep\r\n\r\nImages:\r\n-------\r\n\r\n#### Home page\r\n![Screenshot Home Page](/public/git_img/chitter-home.png)\r\n\r\n#### Sign in\r\n![Screenshot Sign Up](/public/git_img/chitter-login.png)\r\n\r\n#### Add new peep\r\n![Screenshot Home Page](/public/git_img/chitter-post.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
